I knocked up two quick tools for a Sharepoint audit.

shareurls.py is intended for a low privilege user to try and access a large number of administrative urls. It takes a screenshot of each page in Chrome so you can quickly scan the directory and find issues.

shareforce.py uses the darkc0de.lst password file (you need to download this) to brute force the Sharepoint login form.

Note: I used the Chrome Driver but you could easily swap this out for Firefox or Internet Explorer. I may add these in the future.

- Enjoy!
